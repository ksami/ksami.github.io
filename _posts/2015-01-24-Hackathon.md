So i'm currently in the thick of the chaos of Hack & Roll 2015, a hackathon organised by NUS Hackers.
I was gonna live blog about this but it seems I underestimated the chaos of all this.
The post will have to wait.

Meanwhile, for a live feed of just a bit of the chaos, [here](https://github.com/ksami/yalla/commits/master). Commmit messages are known to get funnier towards the deadline.
