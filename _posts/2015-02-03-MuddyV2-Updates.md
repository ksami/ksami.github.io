With sickness comes extremely low productivity. So I shall just post a few updates on what's been happening to muddy.

I've managed to get the Player to move on every trigger so I guess that's progress.

My Arch VM has been acting up on me lately with random stutters and freezes but nothing fatal. Probably something to do with my reallocation of RAM the other day. BTW I'm using the Arch VM because Meteor doesn't support Windows yet and it would take a horrid load of work to make it run in cygwin.

Currently stuck on whether to have map controllers use a database or not.

Still torn between Meteor's tightly coupled nature and my software engineering lecturer's principle of "High Cohesion and Low Coupling". Also going a little crazy over Meteor's reactive data; I'm actually digging into lessons learnt during my Real-time Operating Systems module and VHDL in Electrical Engineering modules on asynchronicity, race-conditions, parallel executions and the like to control Meteor's auto updates.

Kinda sorted out KineticJS and its display and capture of events so I don't have to touch it for quite some time.

Yup, and that concludes today's post. Tune in next week to find out what happens when the Player meets the Tree!
