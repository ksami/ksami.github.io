It's always fun to discover and play around with other people's config files; I just spazzed a little over the beautifully designed desktop [Twily](http://twily.info/) has (he/she even has a whole nicely decorated website displaying all of his/her config files) and took the liberty of sampling a few.

For those who don't know what dotfiles are about, they're simply a repository (version-controlled and in the cloud) to organise all your personal config files for the apps you use the most. That way, you can switch machines and still be able to keep your environment just the way you like it.

My dotfiles are on my [Github](https://github.com/ksami/dotfiles) and I use it to organise config files for vim, firefox, git, zsh among others along with some useful scripts. For firefox it's not the config files but [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/) css files for styling webpages and firefox itself. For zsh and git it's mostly aliases. For vim it's plugins and colour schemes.

*I really need to stop doing this, customising/ricing takes too much time... but the results are just too nice! ><*
