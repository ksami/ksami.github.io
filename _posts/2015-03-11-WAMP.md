You may have heard of the LAMP stack which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, a very popular bunch of technologies for web servers. Linux for the OS, Apache for the web server itself, MySQL for the database, PHP for the server-side language.

I tried [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) yesterday, the Windows version of LAMP. It is available as just one installer and can be run with one click. I was honestly taken aback a little at the ease of installation and use after having had so much trouble struggling with servers in the past.

Once WAMP is running, place your php/html files into `www` in the WAMP installation folder (default `C:\WAMP`) and, using your web browser, navigate to `localhost/filename`. So simple!

I haven't tried the MySQL database part yet so new post when I do.
