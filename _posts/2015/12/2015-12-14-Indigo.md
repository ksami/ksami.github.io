Carrying on the momentum from the music module that I took, I'm releasing, something I've always wanted to do, an EDM track. Feedback is welcome but don't be too harsh please, my ego is fragile :(

MP3 version of the track is downloadable from the SoundCloud page, I'll provide the uncompressed WAV too if anyone wants it.
