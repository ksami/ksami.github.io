Recently, I've been testing out working on my desktop with the taskbar hidden so save that tiny bit of screen real estate. I found that I lost track of time very easily though with the taskbar clock hidden away too. Thus I came up with this simple digital clock, forced to always be on top of any other window. The code is available at [ksami/deskclock](https://github.com/ksami/deskclock) and both 32 and 64-bit binaries for Windows have been released at [ksami/deskclock/releases](https://github.com/ksami/deskclock/releases).
