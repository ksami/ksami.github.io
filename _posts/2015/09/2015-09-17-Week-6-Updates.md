## Misc
Finally created a sound I'm okay with after much tweaking and playing around with track stacks for the melody. Also created another track stack for the bass to fatten it up. Applied the _humanize_ MIDI transform onto the drums but honestly I think my listening isn't good enough to hear the difference. Added a few effects here and there like reverb on the drums and electric guitar to make them sound more "echo-y". Also added compressors on the drums and bass to give them a bit more punch. I realised my earphones are skewed towards the trebles which is why my tracks have been sounding so bassy. Will have to borrow a better or flatter pair ASAP and equalise everything.
