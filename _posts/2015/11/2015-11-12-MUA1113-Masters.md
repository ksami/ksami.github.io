edit: Added process of mastering

## Misc
For all the tracks, I mastered them by firstly removing DC gain. Then I used volume automation to cut off the ends of the track. The tracks were EQ-ed again, cutting off the lowest and highest frequencies as well as emphasising the loudest frequencies by boosting them a little. The exciter was then applied to the tracks to add brightness. Stereo spread was used to further spread the sound left and right.

The multi-channel compressor, multipressor, was then used to compress and increase the gain of the different frequency bands. I used this to emphasise the vocals more over the other instruments in the tracks with vocals. Finally, I used the limiter to set a -0.1dB limit on the tracks and boost gain to increase overall volume.
