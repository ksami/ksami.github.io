I'm a student at NUS studying Computer Engineering (read: 75% Computer Science + 75% Electrical Engineering).

In this course we do almost everything related to computers with the ultimate aim being to understand how computers work; from the movements of electrons to the workings of an Operating System to web technologies, we've studied them all.

Thinking back on this now, I can't believe I actually did all that. But trust me, it is satisfying to finally begin to understand the mysterious device known as a computer.
