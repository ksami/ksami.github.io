## Model

### Form
Intro | Verse | Chorus | Verse | Chorus | Bridge | Vamp | Chorus | Intro

### Feel
Feel of the song would be melancholic and would not vary much on the excitement level throughout the song.

### Instrumentation
- Lots of pad to create the ambient effect
- Overdriven electric guitar
- Simple drums pattern
- Running rhythmic element using the piano
- No vocals because I can't sing or write lyrics
- Synth lead for the melody


## What I've done so far
There aren't any screenshots since I've been having trouble saving files with Logic Pro in the lab.
