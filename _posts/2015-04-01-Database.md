I wrote my notes while studying for database design in markdown so I thought I might as well share it here.

Based on the slides publicly available from [Database System Concepts](http://db-book.com/db6/slide-dir) Chapter 1-4

# Database Notes

## Chapter 1 - Intro to Databases

### DBMS
- Set of programs to access data
- Environment both *convenient* and *efficient* to use

### Drawbacks of filesystems as DB
- Data redundancy/duplication and inconsistency of info
- Difficult to access data
- Data isolation
    - Data in multiple files and formats
- Integrity problems
    - Constraints in code instead of being stated explicitly
    - Hard to add new constraints or change existing ones
- No atomicity
    - Partial updates may be carried out in event of failure
- Concurrent access by multiple users
    - For performance
    - Uncontrolled concurrent access leads to inconsistencies
- Security and access control issues

### DBMS uses ACID principle
- Atomicity
    - If one part of transaction fails, entire transaction should fail
- Consistency
    - Any transaction can only change the database in allowed ways
- Isolation
    - Concurrent transactions result in system state identical to if transactions were executed serially
- Durability
    - Results of a transaction are stored permanently even in the event of power loss, crashes or errors

### DBMS Levels of abstraction
- Physical level
    - Describes how a record is stored on the physical disk
- Logical level
    - Describes how data is stored in a database and the relationships between data
    - SQL create table statement
- View level
    - Applications hide details of data types
    - Hides information for security purposes

### Instances and Schemas
- Physical Data Independence
    - Ability to modify the physical level of database design without changing the logical schema
    - Applications depend on logical level of database design (schema)

### Relational data model
- Tabular data with rows (records) and columns (fields)
- Data can have relationships with other tables' data

### Database language
- Data Defnition Language (DDL)
    - Language for defining database schema
    - Create
    - Includes integrity constraints like primary key and referential intergrity
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
    - Language for manipulating data
    - Insert / Delete / Update
    - Procedural
        - User specifies what data is required and how to get those data
    - Non-procedural (Declarative)
        - User specifies what data is required
        - SQL
- Query Language
    - Language for accessing data
    - Select
- SQL has *all three*

### Database Design
- If values in a field are being repeated many times, a new table should be created with a relation back to the original table


-----

## Chapter 2 - Intro to Relational Model

### Relation
- Attributes / Fields / Columns
    - Domains are the set of allowed values for each attribute
    - ***null*** is a member of every domain
- Example of relation
    - *instructor* = (ID, name, dept_name, salary)

### Database
- Consists of multiple relations
- Information about an enterprise broken up into parts
- Bad design eg. *univ* = (instructor_ID, name, dept_name, salary, student_ID, ...) results in:
    - Repetition of information (eg. two students with the same instructor)
    - Need for ***null*** values (eg. student with no advisor)

### Keys
- K is a **superkey** of R if values of K can uniquely identify a tuple (record) of each possible relation r(R)
    - eg. {ID} and {ID,name} are superkeys of *instructor*
- Superkey K is a **candidate key** if K is minimal
    - eg. {ID} is a candidate key
- Candidate key chosen by database designer as principal means of identifying tuples within a relation is a **primary key**
    - eg. {ID} chosen as primary key
- **Foreign key** constraint / integrity means that the value in one relation must appear in another as the **referencing / referenced** relation

### Relational Query Language
- Selection of tuples / records / rows
    - Select a subset of all rows
- Selection of columns / attributes / fields
    - Select a subset of all columns
    - Discard duplicate values
- Joining two relations - Cartesian Product
    - For every row in *r*
        - For every row in *s*
            - Create new row in *r* x *s* with all columns from both relations
- Union of two relations
- Set difference of two relations
    - *r* exclude *s*
- Set intersection of two relations
- Joining two relations - Natural Join
    - For every row in *s*
        - If row in *s* has values in the same columns as a row in *s*, create new row with matched columns and append other existing columns' values

## Chapter 3 - SQL

### SQL Data Definition Language (DDL)


#### Create Table
 
```
create table instructor(
    ID          char(5),
    name        varchar(20) not null,
    dept_name   varchar(20),
    salary      numeric(8,2),
    primary key(ID),
    foreign key(dept_name) references department);
```
`not null` is an integrity constraint, *name* cannot take a ***null*** value

```
create table takes(
    ID          varchar(5),
    course_id   varchar(8),
    sec_id      varchar(8),
    semester    varchar(6),
    year        numeric(4,0),
    grade       varchar(2),
    primary key(ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year),
    foreign key(ID) references student,
    foreign key(course_id, sec_id, semester, year) references section);
```  
Since *sec_id* is in the primary key, a student can be registered for two sections of the same course in the same semester and year

#### Drop
`drop table student`
Deletes entire table and contents

#### Alter
`alter table student add name varchar(20)`
`alter table student drop name`
Dropping of attributes not usually supported


### SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML)

#### Basic query structure

```
select [attribute 1], [attribute 2], ...
from [relation 1], [relation 2], ...
where [predicate]
```
Result of an SQL query is a relation

#### Select
`select name from instructor`
Lists the attributes desired in the result of a query, names are case-insensitive

`select distinct dept_name from instructor`
Removes duplicates; the keyword `all` instead of `distinct` will specify instead that duplicates not be removed

`select * from instructor`
`*` denotes all attributes

`select ID, name, salary/12 from instructor`
Arithmetic expressions allowed in `select`; in this case *salary* is divided by 12 when returned

#### Where
Specifies conditions the result must satisfy (selection predicate)

`select name from instructor where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.' and salary > 80000`
Logical connectives *and*, *or*, *not* can be combined with comparisons

#### From
Lists relations involved in the query; creates a Cartesian product of all the relations involved

`select * from instructor, teaches`
Returns every possible instructor-teaches pair with all attributes from both relations

#### Joins
`select section.course_id, semester, year, title from section, course where section.course_id = course.course_id and dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.'`

#### Natural Joins
`select * from instructor natural join teaches`

Beware of unrelated attributes with the same name getting equated
Incorrect: `select name, title from instructor natural join teaches natural join course`
Correct: `select name, title from (instructor natural join teaches) join course using (course_id)`

#### Rename
`select ID, name, salary monthly_salary from instructor`
Refers to *salary* as *monthly_salary* instead

`select distinct T.name from instructor T, instructor S where T.salary > S.salary and S.dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.'`
Find names of all instructors who have higher salary than some instructor in 'Comp. Sci.'; Self join to compare records in same table

#### Like
`select name from instructor where name like '%da\%r_' escape '\'`
% matches any substring, _ matches any character, `escape` defines an escape character

#### Order by
`select distinct name from instructor order by dept_name, name desc`

#### Between
`select name from instructor where salary between 90000 and 100000`

#### Set operations
`(select course_id from section where sem='Fall') union (select course_id from section where sem='Spring')`
Set operations `union`, `intersect` and `except` automatically eliminate duplicates, to retain them use `union all`, `intersect all` and `except all`

#### Null
`select name from instructor where salary is null`
***null*** signifies an unknown value or a value that does not exist

#### Aggregate Functions
`select avg(salary) from instructor where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.'`
Aggregate functions `avg`, `count`, `min`, `max`, `sum` return a value; all aggregate functions exclude ***null*** values except `count(*)` which counts the number of records in a table

`select dept_name, avg(salary) from instructor group by dept_name`
Resulting relation has columns *dept_name* and *avg_salary* with each row being the average salary of instructors for that department

`select dept_name, avg(salary) from instructor group by dept_name having avg(salary) > 42000`
Predicates in the *having* clause are applied after the formation of groups while predicates in the *where* clause are applied before forming groups

#### Nested Subqueries
Intersection
```
select distinct course_id
from section
where semester = ’Fall’ and year= 2009 and 
        course_id in (select course_id
                    from section
                    where semester = ’Spring’ and year= 2010);
```

Exclusion
```
select distinct course_id
from section
where semester = ’Fall’ and year= 2009 and 
        course_id not in (select course_id
                        from section
                        where semester = ’Spring’ and year= 2010);
```

Comparing with some (at least one) records in another query
```
select name
from instructor
where salary > some (select salary
                    from instructor
                    where dept_name = ’Biology’);
```

Comparing with all records in another query
```
select name
from instructor
where salary > all (select salary
                    from instructor
                    where dept_name = ’Biology’);
```

Check if subquery is nonempty
```
select course_id
from section as S
where semester = ’Fall’ and year= 2009 and 
        exists (select *
                from section as T
                where semester = ’Spring’ and year= 2010 
                        and S.course_id= T.course_id);
```

Check if subquery is empty
```
select distinct S.ID, S.name
from student as S
where not exists ( (select course_id
                    from course
                    where dept_name = ’Biology’)
                except
                    (select T.course_id
                    from takes as T
                    where S.ID = T.ID));
```

Tests for absence of duplicate tuples in result; returns true on empty set
```
select T.course_id
from course as T
where unique (select R.course_id
            from section as R
            where T.course_id = R.course_id
                    and R.year = 2009);
```

##### Subqueries in From clause
```
select dept_name, avg_salary
from (select dept_name, avg (salary) as avg_salary
        from instructor
        group by dept_name)
where avg_salary > 42000;
```

#### With
Defines a temporary view (relation) only available to the query where *with* occurs; in this case, *max_budget* is the temporary table
```
with max_budget(value) as
    (select max(budget)
    from department)
select budget
from department, max_budget
where department.budget=max_budget.value;
```

#### Delete
`delete from instructor where dept_name = 'Finance'`

`delete from instructor where salary > (select avg(salary) from instructor)`
`avg` is computed for every tuple, as `delete` runs, `avg` changes; compute `avg` first then delete

#### Insert
`insert into instructor values('10211', 'Smith', 'Biology', 66000);`
Follows the order of fields declared in the `create` statement

`insert into instructor (ID, name, dept_name, salary) values('10211', 'Smith', 'Biology', 66000);`
If cannot remember order of the attributes

`insert into student select ID, name, dept_name, 0 from instructor`
Inserts all instructors into the student relation with tot_creds set to 0

#### Update
`update instructor set salary = salary * 1.03 where salary > 100000;`
Increases instructors' salaries whose salary is above 100000 by 1.03 times

```
update instructor
set salary = case
                when salary <= 100000 then salary * 1.05
                else salary * 1.03
            end
```
Increases instructors' salaries depending on their salary

## Chapter 4 - Intermediate SQL

### Outer join
Similar to join but uses ***null*** values for tuples that to not match tuples in the other relation; avoids loss of information
`course left outer join prereq on course.course_id = prereq.course_id`
`course natural right outer join prereq`
`course natural full outer join prereq`

### Joined relations
- Join condition
    - Defines which tuples in the two relations match and which attributes are in the result of the join
    - `inner join`, `left outer join`, `right outer join`, `full outer join`
- Join type
    - Defines how tuples in each relation that do not match any tuple in the other relation are treated
    - `natural`, `on <predicate\>`, `using (attributes)`

### Views
`create view v as <query expression>`
View *v* is a virtual relation not a new relation, the expression is saved into view *v* and substituted into queries

```
create view faculty as
    select ID, name, dept_name
    from instructor
```
```
create view biology_faculty as
    select ID, name
    from faculty
    where dept_name = 'Biology'
```
Views can be defined from other views

### Integrity constraints

#### Unique
`unique (attributes)`
States that attributes form a candidate key

#### Check
`check (predicate)`
Ensures predicate is satisfied

```
create table section (
    course_id varchar (8),
    sec_id varchar (8),
    semester varchar (6),
    year numeric (4,0),
    building varchar (15),
    room_number varchar (7),
    time slot id varchar (4), 
    primary key (course_id, sec_id, semester, year),
    check (semester in (’Fall’, ’Winter’, ’Spring’, ’Summer’))
); 
```

#### Referential integrity
- Ensures value that appears in one relation for a given set of attributes also appears for a certain set of attributes in another relation
    - eg. if "Biology" appears in one of the tuples in *instructor*, then there should exist a tuple in *department* for "Biology"
    - *dept_name* is then a foreign key of *instructor* and a primary key of *department*

##### Cascade
```
create table course (
    course_id varchar(8)
    ...
    dept_name varchar(20),
    foreign key (dept_name) references department (dept_name)
        on delete cascade
        on update cascade (or set null),
    ... );
```
Instead of simply rejecting a delete of Biology department, `on delete cascade` deletes all courses the Biology department offers and `on update cascade` updates fields accordingly; alternatives for `cascade` are `set null` and `set default`

#### Deferrable
```
create table person (
    ID char(10),
    name char(40),
    mother char(10),
    father  char(10),
    primary key ID,
    foreign key father references person(ID) deferrable,
    foreign key mother references  person(ID) deferrable)
```
Defers constraint checking until the end of a transaction

### Default
```
create table student (
    ID varchar (5),
    name varchar (20) not null,
    dept_name varchar (20),
    tot_cred numeric (3,0) default 0,
    primary key (ID) )
```
Provides default value if no value is given

### Index creation
`create index studentID_index on student(ID)`
Data structure used to speed up access to records, queries which specify a value for *student.ID* can now be executed by using the index without looking at all records of *student*

### Built-in data types in SQL
- date
    - `date '2015-04-01'`
- time
    - `time '17:00:30'`
    - `time '17:00:30.75'`
- timestamp
    - `timestamp '2015-04-01 17:00:30.75'`
- interval
    - `interval '1' day`
    - `interval '3-2' year to month`
    - Subtraction between above 3 types gives an `interval`
    - `interval` can be added to above 3 types

### User-defined types
`create type Dollars as numeric(12,2)`

```
create table department
    (dept_name varchar (20),
    building varchar (15),
    budget Dollars);
```

### Domains
```
create domain degree_level varchar(10)
    check(value in ('Bachelors', 'Masters', 'Doctorate'));
```
- Domains can have constraints such as `not null` but types cannot
- Domains are not strongly typed and a value of one type can be transferred to one of another type

### Large object types
- For pictures, videos, CAD files etc.
- `blob`: binary large object whose interpretation is left to an application outside of the database system
- `clob`: character large object is a large collection of character data

```
create table pictures(
    name varchar(12),
    pic blob(32MB));
```

```
select pic
from pictures
where name like '%SNU%';
```
