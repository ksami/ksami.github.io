Switching from Unreal Engine to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) for game development has been a breath of fresh air; I don't have to struggle with arcane undocumented functions, or wait forever to build the project or launch the editor anymore.

In hindsight, Unreal Engine was jumping in the deep end for me and overkill for my goals anyway.

Came across [Dialogic](https://dialogic.pro/), a visual novel framework for Godot, which is a breeze to use with its visual editor backed by a simple text format; allows for using whatever method works best, eg. visual editor for setting event parameters, text editor for bulk changes.

Whipped up a very short (<5 mins) visual novel, hope it's a fun read!
