When using git at the command line, a quick way to check changes that have been made is `git diff`. This however only shows changes that have not yet been staged, that is, changes made before `git add`.

`git diff HEAD` shows changes that have been made after a `git add` but before a `git commit`.

`git diff HEAD HEAD^` shows the difference between `HEAD` and its previous commit.


`git log --decorate=short` will show where `HEAD` is as well as other tags.
