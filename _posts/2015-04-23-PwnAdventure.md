One of the top links on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) today is about [PwnAdventure](http://pwnadventure.com), a game where "hacking the game **is** the game". Seems that anything goes since the devs have released it with that aim. Anyway, go check it out if you are interested in security research, sure beats just staring at tools and code.
