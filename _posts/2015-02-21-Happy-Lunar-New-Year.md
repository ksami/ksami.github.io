Happy Lunar New Year to you dear reader! 新年快乐! 새해 복 많이 받으세요!

I will be leaving Singapore in less than a week for exchange to Korea (South) for studies for a semester. Sadly, this means I *might* be too busy to continue development of muddyv2 again due to schoolwork. Would depend heavily on how much stressful school in Korea would be.

Anyway, this blog will definitely continue as I post about interesting new things I learn. Stay tuned!​
