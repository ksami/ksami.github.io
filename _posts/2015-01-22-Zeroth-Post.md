Always heard that it'll be good for a developer to maintain a blog so I've finally got down to it. I'll try my best to update regularly but don't expect too much.  
Main posts will be about technology, chronicling my journey as a dev and, if you are lucky, rants. Also, I will most likely use this site as a testbed for learning web stuff so don't get too attached to the layouts and design.  
Please bear with the ugliness and placeholders while I take my own sweet time to update everything :)  `- ksami`
