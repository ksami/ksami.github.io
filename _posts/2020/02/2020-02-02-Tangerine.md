EDM track with probably my best (virtual) drumming, and most impactful drop yet

#### Arrangement

[![](/images/2020-02-02-arrangement.png)](/images/2020-02-02-arrangement.png)

#### Electric Guitar
Recorded with a cheap audio adapter, passed through the [Guitar Rig 5 Player](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/guitar/guitar-rig-5-player/), and heavily edited because I cannot keep a beat...

#### Drop
A combination of very interesting samples of punches from [Punching Percussion from 99Sounds](http://99sounds.org/fight-sound-effects/) and a crash cymbal hit

#### Drums
Samples from [Cymatics free sample packs](https://cymatics.fm/pages/free-download-vault), loaded in the neat little sampler [Sitala](https://decomposer.de/sitala/)

#### Synth
[T-Force Alpha Plus 2](https://mastrcode-music.de/en/vst-plugins/t-force-alpha-plus-2/)
The gritty sound after the silence around 1:30 was a happy little accident, appeared as a result of the synth engine starting up during the first render, just rolled with it from there

#### DAW
