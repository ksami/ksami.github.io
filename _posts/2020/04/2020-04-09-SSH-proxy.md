Recently stumbled across [sshuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle), a useful tool for proxying connections through a server over SSH.

This is useful when you have SSH access to a server but can't or don't want to setup a full-blown VPN solution on local or the remote server.

It functions much like a VPN, forwarding any TCP connections with the specified destination IP addresses through the proxy server.

It doesn't require that the client application have any special capabilities unlike SOCKS proxies.

An added perk is it doesn't require you to have admin access to the remote server for it to work.

### Usage

A scenario could go like this - to access `destination` in a private network from `local` with SSH access to `remote`:
```
                         +--Private-Network---------------------------------+
                         |                                                  |
+-----------+            |  +------------+             +-----------------+  |
|           |            |  |            |             |                 |  |
|   local   +------SSH------>   remote   +-----TCP----->   destination   |  |
|           |            |  |            |             |                 |  |
+-----------+            |  +------------+             +-----------------+  |
                         |                                                  |
                         +--------------------------------------------------+
```

Firstly, [install sshuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle#obtaining-sshuttle) on `local`.

Secondly setup SSH access with `remote` if it hasn't already been setup; SSH setup can be a whole topic on its own so I won't go into it here.

If you only have the hostname for `destination`, the IP address(es) can be obtained with:
```
host <hostname of destination>
```

Then, assuming SSH access has been setup for `remote`, run the following command on `local`:
```
sshuttle -vr remote <IP or subnet of destination>
```

The `-v` option toggles verbose logging while `sshuttle` runs, this would print a log similar to the following if a connection has been proxied:
```
c : Accept: 192.168.42.121:47523 -> 77.141.99.22:443.
```
