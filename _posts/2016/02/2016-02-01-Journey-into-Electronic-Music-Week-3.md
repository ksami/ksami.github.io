### Style
The style that resonates the most with me is EDM or Electronic Dance Music; a broad term which includes many different sub-genres with new terms being created all the time like techno, house and trance, but which more commonly refers to dance or club music.

### Artist
An artist representative of EDM is Avicii, well known for songs such as "Levels" and "Wake Me Up".

Avicii's songs usually have a steady, pulsating beat, with sweeping white noise, risers and high-pass filtered sounds for the build-up, and a vocal sample as in "Levels" and "I Could Be the One". A few songs also have a somewhat country feel to it as in "The Nights", "Wake Me Up" and "Hey Brother".

His influences include Daft Punk, Swedish House Mafia and Eric Prydz.
