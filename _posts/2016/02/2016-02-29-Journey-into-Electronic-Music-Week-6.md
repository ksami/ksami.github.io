### Swedish House Mafia
Swedish House Mafia was a Swedish (duh) electronic music supergroup, its members are already successful in the music industry on their own, formed in 2008 and split in 2013.

Some of their hits include "Save the World" and "Don't You Worry Child"; both of which I remember listening to quite often on the radio about 4-5 years ago and am quite glad to finally know the title and artist of the song.

The style of their music usually involves pulsating beats, sweeping white noise and frequent use of a filter frequency sweep. It can clearly be seen how Swedish House Mafia has influenced Avicii since both their styles are very similar.

One track that particularly stands out to me is "Greyhound" which I feel has many musically interesting elements.
