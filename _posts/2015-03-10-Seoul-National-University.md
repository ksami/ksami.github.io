So I'm finally here on exchange in South Korea at Seoul National University. It's my first winter and the weather is freezing. My friend insists that it's spring though; if so, I don't know how long I'm gonna take to adjust to this kind of weather.

Posting after quite a long time because I haven't started coding anything. Ever since I arrived I've been trying to settle immigration, administrative, financial and personal issues. Moreover, though school started a week ago, I haven't had to do any work yet.

Most of the day my mind is preoccupied with thoughts on how to keep warm. I even had to google it; just doesn't come naturally to someone who has been living in a tropical country all his life where the lowest temperature is 25 degree Celsius. Walking down the street, I have to clench my teeth to prevent audible chattering from shivering. I wonder if I'm doing something wrong. Anyway, weather is expected to only get warmer from now on so I'm hoping that happens soon.

Courses I'm taking here:  
Database  
Image Processing  
Multi-core Computing  
Programming Language

As I mentioned, there's nothing much to post about so I'll talk about one of the more interesting classes I'm taking here.
