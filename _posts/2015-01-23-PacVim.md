If you are on the [Vim] side of the [Editor Wars](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war)
or are unsure of which editor to choose,
here's a good chance to practise navigating in [Vim]. [PacVim](https://github.com/jmoon018/PacVim) is a game based on pacman
using [Vim] commands to navigate the character and escape from ghosts.
